    <h3>Corrective jaw Surgery:-</h3>
    <p>Corrective jaw surgery, also known as orthognathic surgery, is a procedure used to correct major dental and skeletal irregularities that cannot be treated with orthodontics alone. It aims to improve facial harmony and function by realigning the jaws and teeth. Typically performed by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon, corrective jaw surgery begins with detailed planning using advanced imaging techniques to map out the precise adjustments needed. During the procedure, the surgeon makes incisions inside the mouth to access the jawbones. They then reposition the bones as planned, using screws, plates, or wires to secure them in their new position. This surgery can address conditions such as underbites, overbites, open bites, and facial asymmetry, ultimately improving both the aesthetic appearance and the functionality of the jaw. Recovery involves a period of healing, during which patients may need to follow a special diet and avoid strenuous activities while their jaws adjust to their new alignment.
